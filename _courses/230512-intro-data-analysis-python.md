This workshop will teach you the basic tools available in Python for data analysis. It will particularly focus on Pandas to learn how to:

-     Read in data files
-     Combine data together
-     Summarise and aggregate your data
-     Filter your data
-     Visualise your data 

It will also introduce Jupyter Notebooks as a way of interleaving prose with your code as a form of 'literate programming'.
